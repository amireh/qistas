# Specs

## Running the specs from the CLI

In a separate terminal, run a test server:

    grunt connect:specs

Then run the specs:

    grunt test

## Running the specs from a browser

    grunt connect:specs
    grunt test
    grunt link_assets

Now visit http://localhost:8000 using a browser and you should be able to
run the specs.
