# File Structure

## `bin`

Some "kits" to automate certain tasks, or generate interesting information
Usually, you wouldn't have to use these directly, but use the grunt
interface instead

## `config`

Contains some stock config files for deployment of Pibi on different platforms,
like the web, Chrome Store, or Phonegap

## `doc`

The documentation you're currently viewing. Some of its contents are auto-generated.

### `doc/guides`

Hosts jsduck guides written in markdown. Each guide should be named in an underscore
version of its title. For example, this guide is called "File Structure", and its
folder is `doc/guides/file_structure`.

Each guide has to be registered in the `doc/guides.json` file for it to be listed.

### `doc/api`

Auto-generated by jsduck via the `grunt docs` task or `grunt watch:docs`

## `spec`

Pibi.js tests.

### `spec/unit`

This is where the unit specs live, the specs written here should be as
isolated as possible.

### `spec/integration`

Specs in this folder usually utilize most helpers and interact with
much of the App state

## `www`

This is the tree that will be deployed, it houses the source and vendor code.
